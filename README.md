# GB Camera Test

This test aims to study the timing of the GB Camera. This means using a flash cart to copy the appropriate tests to WRAM then cartswapping to a GB Camera cartridge.

Of note, cartswapping is not possible to do on the GBA for technical reasons, only the DMG and GBC can be used for testing.
